# CodeVember 2018 - Website

This is the website for Codevember community challenge, 2018. A challenge to all creative coders to make something new over the month of November.

This website was built using the [Florence Template](https://demo.cruip.com/florence/) found on [Cruip.com](https://cruip.com/).

## Getting started

Next, use your command line to enter your project directory. This template comes with a ready-to-use package file called `package.json`. You just need to rename it to `package.json`, then run `npm install` to install all of the dependencies into your project.

You're ready to go! Run any task by typing `npm run task` (where "task" is the name of the task in the `"scripts"` object). The most useful task for rapid development is `watch`. It will start a new server, open up a browser and watch for any SCSS or JS changes in the `src` directory; once it compiles those changes, the browser will automatically inject the changed file(s)!
