# CodeVember 2018 - Website

This is the website for Codevember community challenge, 2018. A challenge to all creative coders to make something new over the month of November.

This website was built using the [Global: HTML5 website template](http://buckymaler.com/global) found on github. This project was developed with HTML5, Sass, jQuery, and Hammer.js.

## Running Project:

1. Install sass [Getting Started with Sass](https://sass-lang.com/install).

2. Then cd into your assets Directory.

```cd/codeVember-Website/src/assets```

3. Now watch the sass folder and build your css.

```sass --watch sass:css --style compressed```

4. Start Editing!

## Running Project with Hot reloading (not necessary):

1. Make sure the steps for sass are completed above, and your sass files are being watched.

2. Then cs into your root folder for the project

```cd/codeVember-Website```

3. NPM Install

```npm install```

3. NPM start (this will watch for changes in the project's src folder. So it is watching for changes in the js and html files, and reloading the page as you are working on things, other than sass).

```npm start```
